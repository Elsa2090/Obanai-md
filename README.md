# Devi Bot
Devi is a whatsapp bot created with [@whiskeysockets/baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) and written in javascript(ES6), and this is my first open source project, if there is a mistake feel free to open a issues.


**NOTE:** I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this code, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

### **Prerequisites**
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v18 LTS
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### **Installation**
Clone this project

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Debanjan-San/WhatsApp-Bot-Devi.git
> cd WhatsApp-Bot-Devi
```

Installing the dependencies (**make sure you're in the project directory that you've just cloned**):

```bash
> npm i
```
### **Setup & Using the bot**
1. Create `.env` and fill out the `MONGO` (For example you can see `.env.example`)
2. Run the code
```bash
> npm start
```
3. Open http://localhost:3000/ on your host browser and scan the **QRcode** with your **WhatsApp app** (or you can set the `printQRInTerminal: false` on `index.js` to scan the **QRcode** on the terminal)
4. Start using the bot by sending `#help` to the host/bot account (to change the prefix change it at `getConfig.js`)
